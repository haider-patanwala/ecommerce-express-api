# express-api

This is a simple Express.js API project designed for learning and understanding basic data fetching concepts. The API demonstrates how to handle HTTP requests and persist data by writing to JSON files in the same directory.

Key Features:

- User registration and retrieval
- Order creation and management
- Data persistence using local JSON files
- Basic error handling and status codes

**Note: This is a learning project and not intended for production use.** The implementation uses file-based storage rather than a proper database, and lacks important security features that would be required in a production environment.

To install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

```

```
